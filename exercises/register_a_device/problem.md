To **register a new device** with Meshblu, you will need to post to:
```
https://meshblu.octoblu.com/devices
```
When you create a new device, you can also *add any properties* you want, by *including them in the data*

Let's **add two properties** to our device as we register it:
```
type: drone
color: black
```

Once you have made the request, **log out the response data**
